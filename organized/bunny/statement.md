# Bunny

Alice has a pet bunny, named Bob. She's been taking $k$ pictures of him each day, ever since she got him $d$ days ago. After some time, the photos piled up! Now that she's bought a photo album with $p$ pages, she wants to know how many _additional_ pages she needs to buy given that a page (back-to-back) could store $l$ pictures.

Alice is on a tight budget, so she'd prefer if you minimize this number. Could you please help her out?

For motivation, below is a picture of Alice taking a picture of Bob.
